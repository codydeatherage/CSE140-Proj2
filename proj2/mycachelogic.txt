  You need to read/write between memory (via the accessDRAM() function) and
  the cache (via the cache[] global structure defined in tips.h)

  Remember to read tips.h for all the global variables that tell you the
  cache parameters

  The same code should handle random, LFU, and LRU policies. Test the policy
  variable (see tips.h) to decide which policy to execute. The LRU policy
  should be written such that no two blocks (when their valid bit is VALID)
  will ever be a candidate for replacement. In the case of a tie in the
  least number of accesses for LFU, you use the LRU information to determine
  which block to replace.

  Your cache should be able to support write-through mode (any writes to
  the cache get immediately copied to main memory also) and write-back mode
  (and writes to the cache only gets copied to main memory when the block
  is kicked out of the cache.

  Also, cache should do allocate-on-write. This means, a write operation
  will bring in an entire block if the block is not already in the cache.

  To properly work with the GUI, the code needs to tell the GUI code
  when to redraw and when to flash things. Descriptions of the animation
  functions can be found in tips.h
